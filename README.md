Audio Signal Processing in Python
=================================

This repository holds a few [Jupyter][] (formerly known as [IPython][])
notebooks.

You may consume them in different ways:

* Clone this Git repository (or download the [zip file][]) and open the
  notebooks locally with Jupyter/IPython

* View a static online version of the notebooks:
  [with outputs][],
  [without outputs][]

* [![Launch Binder][badge]][binder] for the ultimate interactive online experience

Please note that the `master` branch contains "executed" notebooks,
i.e. the outputs from code cells (e.g. plots) are stored within the notebooks.
The `dev` branch contains the same notebooks, just without those outputs.
If you want to make a pull request,
please create a new branch based on the `dev` branch
and strip all outputs from the notebooks before committing.
